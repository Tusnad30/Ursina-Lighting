# Ursina Lighting
Realistic lighting in ursina!

If you want to have realistic lighting in ursina, import the **UrsinaLighting.py** in your project and use the **LitObject** class instead of the **Enity** class.
If you need help, ask me (https://discord.gg/JpBPbcKJ) or look in **UrsinaLighting.py** where you can find the source code and an example.

You can use my code in your projects and make private changes to it, but you are not allowed without permission to re-distribute my code to the internet.
